\opening{Dear Hiring Manager,} 
 
 %PARAGRAPH ONE: State the reason for the letter, name the position or type of work you are applying for and identify the source from which you learned of the opening (i.e. career development center, newspaper, employment service, personal contact).
 
%I am excited to see that Lockheed Martin RMS is hiring a Software Autonomy Engineer for  implementing deep learning perception and tracking on unmanned underwater vehicles. With my background in Ocean Engineering and my current research in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) controls of turbulent CFD simulations, I am confident I have the skills to be successful in this role.

I am a Doctoral Candidate at Florida Atlantic University finishing my studies in applied machine learning and computational fluid dynamics writing to apply for the Machine Learning Engineer Associate role at Lockheed RMS AI. I have always admired Lockheed's mission for advancing technology but after attending a presentation by Dr. Brent Segal and hearing of the excellent research into machine learning I am truly excited for the many innovations being pursued at the company. With my current experience in applied machine learning and my background in ocean systems engineering, I believe I make an excellent candidate for this position.
 
%PARAGRAPH TWO: Indicate why you are interested in the position, the company, its products, services - above all, stress what you can do for the employer. If you are a recent graduate, explain how your academic background makes you a qualified candidate for the position. If you have practical work experience, point out specific achievements or unique qualifications. Try not to repeat the same information the reader will find in the resume. Refer the reader to the enclosed resume or application which summarizes your qualifications, training, and experiences. The purpose of this section is to strengthen your resume by providing details which bring your experiences to life. 

My undergraduate and graduate courses covered many topics including taking sonar data from AUVs, signal processing from various instrumentation and data analysis on the resulting information. My undergraduate capstone project was designing, building, and programming an autonomous surface vehicle capable of GPS waypoint navigation and station keeping. I was the electrical team lead in charge of instrumentation integration but also programmed and tested our Arduino microcontroller. Within our 8 month time-frame and \$1,500 budget, our prototype could station keep to a 1.5 bodylength radius with 95\% accuracy. 

In the early stages of my PhD research, I used 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to estimate turbulent conditions with under 10\% error (Python, Fortran). Now, I am using a combination of CNNs and Long-Short Term Memory for perception and tracking and Deep Reinforcement Learning for autonomous actuation control within turbulent fluid simulations (C++, Fortran) with the goal of drag reduction. My PhD has been a wonderful experience, providing me skills in advanced mathematics and physics, software engineering, machine learning, and data science. I have learned Python, Fortran, and R, employed High Performance Computing, used various ML Libraries (SciKit, TensorFlow, Keras, Smarties), developed strong communication skills through conference presentations and teaching and I am ready to start utilizing these for real world applications. 
 
%PARAGRAPH THREE: Request a personal interview and indicate your flexibility as to the time and place. Repeat your phone number in the letter and offer assistance to help in a speedy response. For example, state that you will be in the city where the company is located on a certain date and would like to set up an interview. Alternatively, state that you will call on a certain date to set up an interview. End the letter by thanking the employer for taking time to consider your credentials. 

I earnestly thank you for your time and consideration in this role. My resume and website will provide additional details about my projects and qualifications. I would genuinely enjoy discussing this opportunity with you further. Please do not hesitate to contact me with additional questions.

Sincerely, \\
%\closing{Sincerely yours,}
